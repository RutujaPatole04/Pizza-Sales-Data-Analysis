# Pizza-Sales-Data-Analysis
🚀 Excited to share my project on Pizza Sales Data Analysis! 🍕
I delved into a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data for the year 2015. The project involved several key components:
📊 Data Import and SQL Analysis:
Imported a dataset of 48,620 rows from CSV to MS SQL Server.
Created tables and wrote SQL queries to generate insights, including identifying total revenue of $817,860.05.
📈 Excel Data Processing and Dashboard Creation:
Connected Excel to SQL Server for seamless data integration.
Cleaned and processed data using Excel formulas and pivot tables.
Developed a dynamic dashboard featuring key KPIs such as best and worst selling pizzas, percentage of sales by category and size, and peak sales hours.
🔍 High-Level Insights:
Identified the best and worst selling pizzas to inform inventory decisions.
Highlighted daily and hourly sales trends to improve resource allocation.
Created visualizations to showcase total pizzas sold by category and top/bottom sellers.
This project not only honed my skills in SQL and Excel but also demonstrated the power of data-driven decision making. I'm excited to apply these insights to future projects and continue leveraging data to drive business success!
